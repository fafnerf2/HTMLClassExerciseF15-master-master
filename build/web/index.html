    <h1 id=ttle>Welcome to my site. <br> Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
        <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
            holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite 
            Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
        <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite 
            Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email 
            list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween. </p>
